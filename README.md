# GIVEAWAY WHEEL

Instead of using the "random name picker" I had previously made in Python to help my girlfriend with an Instagram giveaway, she wanted to use something more visual, to show participants the prize draw.

## Notes:

Names/Colours etc can all be changed in the Index.js file. Wheel automatically adjusts to fit new additions.

Many thanks to CrazyTim for the original components!
